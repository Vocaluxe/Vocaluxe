Vocaluxe is a free and open source singing game. It allows up to three players (currently) to sing along with music using microphones in order to score points, depending on the pitch of the voice and the rhythm of singing.

Vocaluxe is an entirely new development in C#, inspired by the original UltraStar (developed by corvus5) and the great Ultrastar Deluxe project.

Supported Operating Systems / Requirements:
- WinXP, Vista, Windows 7 with .NET 2.0
- 1 GHz CPU, 512 MB RAM, Graphics card with OpenGL 2.1 or DirectX 9.0 support
